if course is scheduled on friday, pick any slot on any other day as the mirror
take the next exisiting course and reserve the timeslot for after that course
next, loop through all the courses if the reserved slot is conflicting with any other course.
if yes, take the conflicting course and reserve for the timeslot next of that
if end of day reached, try the next day
if($courses['day'] == 4) {

} else {
    $coursesCopy['day'] += 2;
}
